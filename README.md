DEAL WITH IT
============

This is a slimed down version of an app i wrote at twitter to troll people around the office.

Basically it uses face detection to make people **DEEEAALLLL WITH IT**.


HOW DO I USE THIS HOTNESS
-------------------------

It's super easy.

**First!** And most important - get the code.

**Then!** Run it.

**Note!** This stuff needs to be on a server, otherwise when you try to run it, it will throw an error. This has something to do with crazy browser security stuff.

**Optionally** You can pass a message through the url to display instead of the default "deal with it". Like for example

    http://fat.github.com/dealwithit/?message=fat actually aint so fat

**ALSO NOTE** Not all images work!

For example, this image will not work

![Bad](http://fat.github.com/dealwithit/img/bad.jpg)

but this will!


![Good](http://fat.github.com/dealwithit/img/good.jpg)
