DEAL WITH IT
============

This is a slimed down version of an app i wrote at twitter to troll people around the office with.

Basically it uses facial detection to make people DEEEAALLLL WITH IT.

it's good times.


HOW DO I USE THIS HOTNESS
=========================

It's really easy.

**First!** And most important - get the code.

**Then!** You need to run it.

*NOTE:* it needs to be served by something -- there's this super lame reading image data from local files thing which browsers are SUPER not down with.

**Optionally** You can pass a message to display instead of deal with it. Like for example

    localhost:3000/dealwithit?message=come at me bro

**ALSO NOTE** Not all images work!

For example, this image will not work

![Bad](http://fat.github.com/dealwithit/img/bad.jpg)

but this will!


![Good](http://fat.github.com/dealwithit/img/good.jpg)
